Working in a corporate environment can sometimes cause you to overlook small but important details about your profession. 
Most of the time, youâ€™re working on pre-existing projects, which limits your experience in building something entirely from scratch. 
This creates a comfort zone that might make you unaware of areas where your knowledge is lacking.

To address this, I started developing this project to improve my backend skills from the ground up and identify the small gaps 
in my knowledge that need attention. After completing this project, I plan to continue working on similar projects to develop
into a fully proficient backend developer.
